# Accent-Transformation-Project

Objective
We aim to implement an accent conversion tool that will process a sample sentence and allocate phonemes and output a sentence with either a Midwest, Southern or British accent. The processor will be implemented using a MATLAB program along with an interactive user interface for the user to select the accent of choice. The program will be able to record a userâ€™s voice and play back the output volume.
